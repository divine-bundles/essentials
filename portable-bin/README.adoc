This deployment uses its own asset directory as a portable container for personal executables.

== Deployment installation notes

Basically, everything dropped into this deployment's asset directory immediately becomes available on `$PATH`.
When the Grail directory is synchronized across machines (as it is encouraged to be â€” e.g., using Dropbox or Github), the 'personal directory for binaries/executables', or `.pbin/` becomes portable.

== Included assets

The deployment's asset directory is located at:

[source]
--
grail/assets/portable-bin
--

The asset directory starts empty.

== Dependencies

*This deployment depends on* `*config-shell*` *deployment* (included in current bundle).
Shell start-up commands that ensure `~/.pbin/` directory is on `$PATH` are located in and sourced from:

[source]
--
grail/assets/config-shell/.runcoms/02-env.sh
--

== Supported asset modifications

Personal binaries/executables may be freely dropped into the asset directory.
They will become available from the command line immediately.

== Overwriting policy

During installation of the deployment, anything that pre-exists at the path `~/.pbin` is preserved in the deployment's designated backup directory at:

[source]
--
state/backups/portable-bin/
--

== Deployment removal notes

Upon uninstallation of the deployment, the backup of the possibly overwritten file is automatically restored.

Uninstallation does not remove anything in the asset directory.
