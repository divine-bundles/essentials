The `portable-bin` deployment uses its own asset directory as a portable container for the personal executables.

The `portable-bin` deployment has the priority of `*500*`.

== Deployment installation notes

Basically, everything dropped into the `portable-bin` deployment's *asset directory* immediately becomes available on `$PATH`.
The portability is achieved when the Grail directory is synchronized across machines (as it is encouraged to be â€” e.g., using Dropbox or Github).

|===

== Included assets

The `portable-bin` deployment's *asset directory* is located at `grail/assets/portable-bin`.
This drop-box type directory starts empty.

== Dependencies

The `portable-bin` deployment depends on the `*config-shell*` deployment (included in the current bundle).
The `~/.pbin/` directory is put on the `$PATH` variable from the runcom script at `grail/assets/config-shell/02-env.sh`.

== Supported asset modifications

The binaries/executables may be freely dropped into the asset directory.
They will become available on the command line immediately.

== Overwriting policy

The `portable-bin` deployment backs up any clashing pre-existing file at the `~/.pbin` path.
The backup directory is at `state/backups/portable-bin/`.

== Deployment removal notes

The `portable-bin` deployment is fully reversible: the displaced pre-existing files are restored.

The removal does not touch anything in the asset directory.
