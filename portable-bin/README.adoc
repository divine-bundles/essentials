The `portable-bin` deployment uses its own asset directory as a portable container for the personal executables.

== Included assets

Everything dropped into the `portable-bin` deployment's *asset directory* immediately becomes available on `$PATH`.
The portability is achieved when the Grail directory is synchronized across machines (as it is encouraged to be â€” e.g., using Dropbox or Github).
The included asset directory starts out empty.

== Dependencies

The `portable-bin` deployment depends on the <<config-shell-main,`*config-shell*`>> deployment (included in the current bundle).
The `~/.pbin/` directory is put on the `$PATH` variable from the runcom script at `https://github.com/no-simpler/divine-dotfiles#fmwk-grail[grail]/assets/config-shell/02-env.sh`.
