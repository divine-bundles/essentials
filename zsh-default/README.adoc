The `zsh-default` deployment ensures that https://sourceforge.net/projects/zsh[Zsh] is the default shell for the current OS user.

== Installation map

After some preparations (involving the `/etc/shells` file), the `zsh-default` deployment calls the `chsh -s _<path to zsh>_` command to change the default shell.
Note that *changing the default shell requires the user's password*.
The password prompt will appear during the installation/removal.

== Included assets

The `zsh-default` deployment does not include any assets.

== Dependencies

The `zsh-default` deployment is stand-alone.

On some systems, the <<dpls-dfls,Divinefile>> included with the current bundle ensures that the `chsh` utility is installed.
