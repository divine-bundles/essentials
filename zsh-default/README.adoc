This deployment ensures that https://sourceforge.net/projects/zsh[Zsh] is the default shell for the current OS user.

This deployment has the priority of `*1333*`.

== Deployment installation notes

After some preparations, this deployment calls `chsh -s _<path to zsh>_` to change default shell.
Note that *changing the default shell requires user's password*.
Password prompt will appear during the installation.

== Included assets

The deployment's does not use an asset directory.

== Dependencies

This deployment is stand-alone.

On some systems, Divinefile included with the current bundle ensures that `chsh` is installed.

== Supported asset modifications

This deployment provides no modifiable assets.

== Overwriting policy

The deployment does not overwrite any files.

If the default shell is already Zsh, this deployment does nothing.

== Deployment removal notes

Every step that this deployment takes during installation is documented, such as adding Zsh to `/etc/shells` file.
Upon uninstallation of the deployment, all performed steps are reversed, from last to first.

If the default shell has not been changed during the installation, it will not be changed during uninstallation as well.
