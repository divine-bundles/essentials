The `home-dirs` deployment maintains a stable tree of personal directories under the home directory.

The `home-dirs` deployment:

* parses the `*home-dirs.cfg*` file as a https://github.com/divine-dotfiles/divine-dotfiles#queue-mnf[queue manifest];
* treats entries as relative paths;
* ensures that the paths correspond to sub-directories under the home directory.

== Included assets

The `home-dirs.cfg` is a https://github.com/divine-dotfiles/divine-dotfiles#queue-mnf[queue manifest].
It uses the key-value pairs to denote sections or entries that are only relevant for particular OS's.
By default, every entry is relevant everywhere.

A whitespace-separated list of OS's may be provided.
The entire list may be negated by prepenting it with an exclamation mark (`!`).

A key-value that appears on a line of its own comes into effect for the remainder of the manifest, or until overridden.
A key-value on the same line with an entry affects only that entry.
