This deployment maintains a set of system dependencies on macOS using https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-bundle[Brewfile].

== Deployment installation notes

This deployment delegates to https://brew.sh/[Homebrew] to install whatever items are listed in the provided Brewfile.

== Included assets

The deployment's asset directory is located at:

[source]
--
grail/assets/brewfile
--

The included `*Brewfile*` starts up empty, and as such does nothing.
This is mostly due to all fundamental dependencies being handled by the included Divinefile.
So, yeah, Brewfile is kind of scoffed on around here.
But anyway…

== Dependencies

This deployment is stand-alone.

When launched on macOS, the _Divine.dotfiles_ itself will do its best to ensure https://brew.sh/[Homebrew] is installed.

== Supported asset modifications

The Brewfile may be freely modified in place.
For the changes to take effect, the deployment must be (re-)installed.
Renaming or moving the Brewfile will break the deployment.

== Overwriting policy

This is all in Homebrew's hands, and depends on the content of the Brewfile.
Still, no major clobbering is expected.

== Deployment removal notes

Uninstalling Brewfile is generally not supported by Homebrew.

This deployment provides a workaround.
Upon uninstallation of the deployment, the Brewfile will be read in reverse order, and for every supported line, an appropriate Homebrew uninstallation command will be called.
Be advised, that this is not exactly the same as reversing installation due to possibility of transient dependencies, as well as other possible factors.

Currently, uninstallation of the following Brewfile lines is supported:

* `tap _<name>_` — taps will be untapped.
* `cask _<name>_` — casks will be uninstalled.
* `brew _<name>_` — bottles will be uninstalled.

Uninstallation does not remove anything in the asset directory.
