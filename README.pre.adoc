<em>A deployment bundle for <a href="https://github.com/divine-dotfiles/divine-dotfiles">Divine.dotfiles</a></em>
</p>
++++

The deployment bundle `*essentials*` for link:{url_dd}[_Divine.dotfiles_] is a collection of opinionated system set-up scripts.
It is intended as a useful starting point for any https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix-like[Unix-like] box.

(Additionally, this bundle showcases the recommended use of the mechanisms built into the current version of the link:{url_dd}[_Divine.dotfiles_] framework.)

[[bundle-main]]
== Description

Once the bundle is fully <<inun-inst,installed>>, and the shell reloaded, _voil√†_:

* https://sourceforge.net/projects/zsh[Zsh] is the default shell.
* Zsh is augmented with https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-completions[completions], https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting[syntax highlighting], and https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions[auto-suggestions].
* Basic necessities, such as https://git-scm.com[Git], https://www.vim.org[Vim], and https://gnupg.org[GnuPG] are available.
* Both https://ohmyz.sh[oh-my-zsh] and https://github.com/Bash-it/bash-it[Bash-it] frameworks are installed and loaded.
* A minimalistic theme for both shell frameworks is active.
* Opinionated configs are plugged in for Git, Vim, Bash, and Zsh.
* Any pre-existing files that have gotten in the way are safely backed up or re-used.

All of the above is controlled and customized through the key configuration files, which are located at `~/link:{url_dd}#fmwk-grail[.grail]/assets/`.

[[inun-main]]
== Installing and uninstalling the bundle

The bundle `essentials` requires the link:{url_dd}[_Divine.dotfiles_] framework.
The (un)installation guide assumes that _Divine.dotfiles_ is installed into the default path: `~/.divine/`, and that the shortcut command `di` is available.

[[inun-inst]]
=== Installing the bundle

With _Divine.dotfiles_ already link:{url_dd}#fmwk-install[installed], the following Terminal command *attaches* the bundle `essentials` to the link:{url_dd}#fmwk-grail[Grail directory]:

[source,bash]
----
di attach essentials
----

And the following Terminal command *installs* the attached bundle:

[source,bash]
----
di install --bundle essentials
----

[.note]
[%noheader,cols="<.<a"]
|===
| Any pre-existing files that get in the way are either re-used or backed up.
Upon the uninstallation, such files are restored into their original places.
|===

[[inun-uninst]]
=== Uninstalling the bundle

The following Terminal command *uninstalls* the bundle `essentials`:

[source,bash]
----
di remove --bundle essentials
----

And the following Terminal command *detaches the bundle* from the link:{url_dd}#fmwk-grail[Grail directory]:

[source,bash]
----
di detach essentials
----
