The `config-vim` deployment symlinks the configuration and customization files for https://www.vim.org[Vim] into the home directory.

== Included assets

The `config-vim` deployment's *asset directory* is located at `grail/assets/config-vim`.

The native configuration files, containing an opinionated set of Vim startup commands:

* [[config-vim-rc]]`*.vimrc*` — the primary Vim configuration file.
+
This file includes an installation command for the https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug[vim-plug] (_a minimalist Vim plugin manager_) along with a number of plugins and settings.
* [[config-vim-idearc]]`*.ideavimrc*` — the configuration file for the https://github.com/JetBrains/ideavim[IdeaVim] (_a Vim emulation plugin for IDEs based on the IntelliJ Platform_).
+
If you don't use any of the IntelliJ products, this file is harmless.

[[config-vim-dirs]]
A number of Vim *customization directories* can be created in the root of the `.vim/` directory, as containers for your customizations.
Most of these directories are not included with the deployment to prevent clutter.
One keymap is provided as an example:

* `*keymap/shifted.vim*` — the 'Caps Lock' mode toggled by double-tapping `j`.

Overall, the following customization directories are supported by Vim:

* `*after/*` — the files to be loaded after the files in `plugin/`.
* `*autoload/*` — the files to be loaded when they are actually needed.
* `*colors/*` — the color schemes.
* `*compiler/*` — the compiler-related options in the current buffer.
* `*doc/*` — the custom plugin documentation.
* `*ftdetect/*` — the file type detection plugins.
* `*ftplugin/*` — the file type exclusive plugins.
* `*indent/*` — the file type exclusive indentation settings.
* `*keymap/*` — the key mapping files.
* `*lang/*` — the language files.
* `*macros/*`
* `*plugin/*` — the standard plugins.
* `*syntax/*` — the syntax highlighting plugins.
* `*tools/*`

Refer to the Vim https://vimhelp.org[help] for more information on the semantics of each directory.

== Dependencies

The `config-vim` deployment is stand-alone.

The <<dpls-dfls,Divinefile>> included with the current bundle ensures that Vim is installed.
